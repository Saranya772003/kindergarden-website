        <h3>A Fox and The Grapes </h3>
        <br>

        <br>
        <br>
                 <p>One day, a fox became very hungry as he went to search for some food.</p><p> He searched high and low, but couldn’t find something that he could eat.</p>

            <p>Finally, as his stomach rumbled, he stumbled upon a farmer’s wall. </p> <p>At the top of the wall, he saw the biggest, juiciest grapes he’d ever seen. </p> <p>They had a rich, purple color, telling the fox they were ready to be eaten.</p>
            
            <p>To reach the grapes, the fox had to jump high in the air. </p> <p>As he jumped, he opened his mouth to catch the grapes, but he missed.</p> <p> The fox tried again but missed yet again.
            
            He tried a few more times but kept failing.</p>
            
            <p>Finally, the fox decided it was time to give up and go home.</p><p> While he walked away, he muttered, “I’m sure the grapes were sour anyway.”</p>
