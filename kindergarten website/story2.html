        <h3>A Wise Old Owl</h3>
        <br>

        <p>

            There was an old owl who lived in an oak tree.</p><p> Every day, he observed incidents that occurred around him.</p>

          <p>Yesterday, he watched as a young boy helped an old man carry a heavy basket.</p><p> Today, he saw a young girl shouting at her mother. The more he saw, the less he spoke.</p>

      <p>As the days went on, he spoke less but heard more. The old owl heard people talking and telling stories.</p>

       <p>He heard a woman saying an elephant jumped over a fence. He heard a man saying that he had never made a mistake.</p>

       <p>The old owl had seen and heard what happened to people. </p><p>There were some who became better, some who became worse.</p><p> But the old owl in the tree had become wiser, each and every day.</p>

            <h3>MORAL</h3>
            <P>"Be more observant. Talk less and listen more. This will make us wise."</P>
