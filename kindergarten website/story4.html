            One bright autumn day, a family of ants was busy working in the warm sunshine.</p><P> They were drying out the grain they had stored up during the summer when a starving grasshopper came up. With his fiddle under his arm, the grasshopper humbly begged for a bite to eat.</p>

            <P>“What!” cried the ants, “Haven’t you stored any food away for the winter? What in the world were you doing all summer?”</p>
            
            <p>“I didn’t have time to store any food before winter,” the grasshopper whined. “I was too busy making music that the summer flew by.”</p>
            
            <p>The ants simply shrugged their shoulders and said, “Making music, were you? Very well, now dance!” The ants then turned their backs on the grasshopper and returned to work.
